Hello everyone! Today I will describe my game. I called it 'Ala-Too vs AUCA. Tic-tac-toe battle'. 

Important: To play the game you need to run the code through any IDE or code editor. After you should install the library 'Pygame'.

Now you can play the game.

In this game you play on the side of Ala-Too University and the Computer is on the side of the AUCA.

This is a classic version of the game 'Tic-tac-toe'.

At the start of the game, you start the turn and then the computer. 

You must fill three cells to win.

You can fill vertically and win. Here is a screenshot:

You can fill horizontally and win. Here is a screenshot:
