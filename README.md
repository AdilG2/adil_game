Hello everyone! Today I will describe my game. I called it 'Ala-Too vs AUCA. Tic-tac-toe battle'. 

In this game you play on the side of Ala-Too University and the Computer is on the side of the AUCA.

This is a classic version of the game 'Tic-tac-toe'.

At the start of the game, you start the turn and then the computer. 

You must fill three cells to win.

You can fill vertically and win. Here is a screenshot:

You can fill horizontally and win. Here is a screenshot:

If the computer wins, it will show 'AUCA won!'. Here is a screenshot:
